    <h1>The Most Esteemed and Sacred Charter of the Literary Assembly</h1>
  </header>

  <div class="container">
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Preamble</h2>
      <p>Let it be decreed, under the hallowed guidance of wisdom and civility, that the Sacred Circle of the Literary Assembly, an enclave of profound intellect and refined taste, shall henceforth abide by the principles enshrined within this most noble document, ensuring the continuity of its exalted purpose, the mutual edification and celebration of literature.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Article I: On the Prerogative of Flex Guests</h2>
      <p>The Host, as sovereign steward of the evening, is granted the exclusive privilege to extend an invitation to one (1) guest of flexibility, hereinafter referred to as the flex guest.</p>
      <p>Should the Host elect not to exercise this privilege, the remaining Honored Members may, with deference and decorum, propose candidates for the Host’s approval.</p>
      <p>The inviter must solemnly convey to the flex guest that their attendance is a singular occurrence, contingent upon their having thoroughly engaged with the evening’s chosen literary work.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Article II: On the Ascent to Permanent Membership</h2>
      <p>A flex guest may only ascend to the venerable status of Permanent Member upon securing the unanimous approbation of the full assembly, thereby preserving the sanctity and exclusivity of the group.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Article III: On the Sacred Selection of Future Tomes</h2>
      <p>At each gathering of the assembly, every present member shall hold the privilege to propose one (1) literary work for consideration as the subject of the next meeting.</p>
      <p>The assembly shall engage in a process of deliberation, whereupon members shall cast their votes for up to three (3) nominated tomes.</p>
      <p>The tallying of votes shall then determine the victorious literary work, which shall serve as the assembly’s subsequent focus.</p>
      <p>Members absent from the gathering may, with benevolent permission, propose a work for consideration but shall forfeit the right to cast votes, leaving only the present members' voices to shape the collective will.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Article IV: On the Annual Convocation of Governance</h2>
      <p>Once per annum, during the dignified month of November, the assembly shall convene an Annual General Meeting (AGM) at a locale befitting its elevated status, far removed from the humdrum distractions of daily life.</p>
      <p>At this august gathering, the governance of the assembly shall be scrutinized, this Charter refined, and all matters of great import deliberated with solemnity.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Article V: On Financial Equilibrium</h2>
      <p>The assembly shall maintain financial equity through the noble instrument of Splitwise.</p>
      <p>All shared expenses, including the Host’s provision of sustenance, shall be recorded and reconciled before the year’s conclusion, ensuring harmony and fairness amongst the membership.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Article VI: On the Duties of the Host</h2>
      <p>The Host shall preside over the meeting with magnanimity, providing a repast worthy of the assembly’s learned pursuits.</p>
      <p>Such expenses shall be equitably distributed among the membership via the aforementioned mechanism of Splitwise.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Article VII: On the Amendment of This Sacred Charter</h2>
      <p>This Charter, a living testament to the unity and purpose of the assembly, may only be amended through the unanimous consent of its Honorable Members, secured at the AGM or another occasion of suitable gravity.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Thus, under the auspices of camaraderie and intellectual rigor, this Charter stands as a bastion of order, justice, and refinement. Let it govern this assembly with the dignity and solemnity befitting its noble endeavor, ensuring the perpetual illumination of literary discourse. Long may the assembly flourish in its pursuit of enlightenment.</p>
